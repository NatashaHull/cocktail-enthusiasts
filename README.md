Cocktail Enthusiasts
====================
This was my first Ruby on Rails application. Many of the features of this application were the result of me learning something new, or wanting to experiment with what I knew, and doing so through adding features to this application. As a result of my inexperience when creating this application, much of this website is designed and created using scaffolding and does not use very advanced techniques. That said, there are some interesting features to this site worth checking out.

#The Home Page
The home page is not particularly special. However, after finishing codeacademy's web fundementals course, I thought it might be fun to create a static home page for my website from scratch. The home page of this website was the result of that, and it was fun to create.

#Comparing Cocktails
At some point I thought it might be a good idea to compare different cocktails, this was closely related to the appearance of two recipes for the same cocktail. For this feature, I created a new view and controller to handle comparing cocktails that figures out which cocktails have been selected for comparison and then divides the screen that follows between each od the recipes.

#Creating a Cocktail
Later on, after I had gone through codeacademy's jQuery and JavaScript curriculum, I had the idea to create a new feature for this application where you can create a basic type of cocktail (the types are taken from Gary Regan's Joy of Mixology) and select which spirits and mixers to add to the cocktail. This feature (while looking a little ugly) uses jQuery UI to have a tabbed display of each page, represented as a JavaScript function.

#Users
After finishing the Hartl tutorial, I decided that it would be fun to add more features for users. Previously, the database simply stored a username, but did not have a password and was fairly insecure. I ended up adding a sign up page and changing the form in the header for logging in to include a password. (I then added a password for every user of my site and told them what it was and to change it.)
